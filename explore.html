    <p>Banswara is a city in the Banswara district in southern Rajasthan, India. The name, Banswara, came from king ‘Bansiya Bhil’.

      Banswara is also known as "City of a Hundred Islands", which is often referred to as "Cherrapunji of Rajasthan", because it receives the most rain in Rajasthan, as well as for the numerous islands in the Mahi River, often referred to as "Mahati", an alternate name for Mahi river, in Vayu Purana text, which flows through the city. It is the greenest city in Rajasthan due to the heavy rainfall which it receives. The city has a population of 101,017, of whom 51,585 are male and 49,432 are female.
